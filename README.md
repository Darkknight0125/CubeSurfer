## 🛠️ Setup Guide

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone the forked repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <forked-repo-link>
   ```
3. Open the project in Unity (recommended version: Unity 6 (LTS)).

   > **Note:** Open the `Project Folder` as a folder in Unity Hub. If asked about any version change warning, just simply open it, might happen as right now this project is in Unity 6000.23f, and later minor changes might happen.

4. After opening an untitled scene will open, ignore that and navigate to the `First level` scene in the Project Window below, `Goto Project Folder --> Assets --> Scenes --> First Level`. This is where all the scene will be saved.

5. Explore the issue and the project folder and start contributing!

> [!NOTE]
> Your main code and working will be in the `Assets` folder.

> [!CAUTION]
> DO NOT modify any of the settings outside the `Assets` folder until told, as it might break the project!

## ⚡ Development Guidelines

- **Hierarchy**: Maintain a proper hierarchy in Unity scenes.
- **Assets**: Store assets in appropriate folders (e.g., Scripts, Prefabs, Materials).
- **Coding Standards**: Follow standard Unity coding practices and ensure clean, readable code.

> [!CAUTION]
> Failure to follow any of these might result in a tempban!
